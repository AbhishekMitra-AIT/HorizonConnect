										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2011, 20% of companies in the S&amp;P500 published a sustainability report; by 2019 this rose to 90%. In 2021, companies releasing transparent reports on their environmental impacts are now the norm.<br>Assessing environmental impacts using a methodology called Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been a huge leap forward for companies in measuring, managing, and reporting the overall impact they are having on the environment.<br>As companies seek to understand more about the impact they are having on the environment – and how they can reduce it further – they need ever more precise ways of assessing their environmental impacts. To get this level of precision, more and more companies are turning to LCA studies of individual products.<br>Product-level LCA studies are an individualized assessment of how the life cycle of a specific product affects the environment across a wide range of categories, from climate change to ozone depletion and more.<br>The most ambitious companies are looking to perform an LCA study for every product in their portfolio.<br>Product-specific LCA studies are a response to four major sources of pressure to increase disclosure on environmental impact:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Conscious consumerism</strong>– Consumers want to know the environmental impact of the products they purchase</li>



<li><strong>Risk-averse investment</strong>– Investors demand to know that a business is not built on products that pose a high risk to the environment</li>
</ul>



<p>“Companies have a responsibility – and an economic imperative – to give shareholders a clear picture of their preparedness.” – Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Regulation – As more and more countries set l<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/eu-countries-approve-landmark-climate-change-law-2021-06-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>egally binding climate targets</u></a>, regulatory pressure for companies to manage their carbon footprints is increasing</li>



<li>Internal decision-making – Decision-makers need clarity on how to respond to the three pressures above, even down to a product-by-product level</li>
</ul>



<p>The automotive industry is facing new challenges relating to the four pressures above. The focus of the industry’s discussion now goes far beyond direct emission values to include the overall life-cycle environmental impacts of automotive products. A holistic assessment of these product environmental impacts must cover all the major components of the product, including those that come from the upstream supply chain, such as synthetic materials. To satisfy the rise in demand for LCA studies of automotive products, suppliers in the automotive supply chain are under increasing pressure to provide environmental data on each product they provide.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="646" height="412" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AUTOMOTIVE-VALUE-CHAIN.webp" alt="AUTOMOTIVE-VALUE-CHAIN" class="wp-image-2343" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AUTOMOTIVE-VALUE-CHAIN.webp 646w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AUTOMOTIVE-VALUE-CHAIN-300x191.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /></figure>



<p>As useful as product LCA studies are, for them to be practical in the industry they must be both as accurate as possible and easy to produce on a large scale.<br>These two challenges have long been hard to overcome, mostly because of problems related to the data product life cycle assessments rely on.<br>Data that truly represents a product’s entire life cycle, including notoriously opaque supply chains (so-called ‘Scope 3 emissions), has been almost impossible to find. Furthermore, integrating data from the many different stages in a product’s life cycle, including (again) the stages in the upstream supply chain, has also been incredibly difficult.</p>



<p>In short, manually assessing each product’s life cycle impacts on an entire product portfolio is so time-consuming and difficult that it’s often not practical.<br>However, automated LCA tools that combine representative data and automatic data gathering for entire product portfolios are starting to become available.</p>



<p>MHP “Our Partner” and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carbon-minds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Carbon Minds</u></a>&nbsp;have been working together with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gfai.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>GFaI</u></a>&nbsp;to design a comprehensive tool for automated, portfolio-scale product life cycle assessment. The tool works in a five-stage process like this:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">IMPORT EXISTING DATA</h3>



<p>A company imports data it already has in different formats, geographical locations, and systems (like Enterprise Resource Planning systems). From that data, the tool creates a new, consistent database.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CLOSING DATA GAPS</h3>



<p>Most companies track economically relevant data, but not environmental data. The tool fills this environmental data gap with highly specific estimates. These estimates only require existing process data – automated modeling then estimates direct emissions along with other emissions, such as emissions from waste incineration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>IMPORTING SUPPLY CHAIN DATA</strong></h3>



<p>For manufactured goods, up to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/starting-at-the-source-sustainability-in-supply-chains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>90% of a product’s environmental impact</u></a>&nbsp;comes from the supply chain. To account for these impacts, the tool imports data from specialized life-cycle inventory databases like Carbon Minds’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carbon-minds.com/lca-database-for-chemicals-and-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>cm. chemicals</u></a>&nbsp;and others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AUTOMATING THE TOOL</strong></h3>



<p>To run the tool, we install a secure software system and then initialize it with the dataset described above. To keep the data coming in automatically, we connect the system to the company’s internal data sources. This completes the automated environmental assessment system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PRODUCING AND SHARING PRODUCT CARBON FOOTPRINTS</strong></h3>



<p>The company can then use the tool to produce the product life cycle assessment it needs. To share the results, the tool can produce intuitive visuals. These visuals are uploaded seamlessly to an online platform where internal and external stakeholders can view the product LCA results.</p>



<p>With an automated product life cycle assessment tool like this, representative data are combined to create accurate product-specific LCA studies across entire product portfolios.</p>



<p>These are the tools that will empower internal decision-makers to respond to the pressures of consumers, investors, and regulators over these crunch years of the climate crisis.</p>

The degree of networking and automation within our society and economy is steadily increasing. We have new needs, expectations, and habits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The GDPR Sets the Boundaries</h2>



<p>These effects are also prevalent in the automotive industry. Functions that enable (partially) autonomous driving and the use of online services allow each user to tailor the driving experience to their needs. To develop and offer these functions and services, automotive manufacturers must collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of information. However, this data can be problematic since it is often directly linked to a specific user, meaning it is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This legislation came into force within the European Union (EU) on May 25, 2018. The GDPR aims to standardize the rules for processing personal data throughout Europe. It represents the EU’s response to the effects of digital transformation and replaced a previous data protection regulation from 1995. The GDPR makes it necessary to be more careful and follow specific rules when handling personal data.</p>



<p>Since its implementation, there have been numerous cases that demonstrate just how challenging it can be to navigate the digital transformation without properly considering data protection requirements. Tesla is a prominent example from the automotive industry. The Tesla Model 3 has a total of eight cameras that enable 360-degree monitoring of the vehicle’s surroundings when driving and parking. The purpose of these cameras is to document vandalism and similar incidents and to improve Tesla’s autonomous driving systems. Stefan Brink, Baden-Wuerttemberg State Commissioner for Data Protection, views the OEM’s equipment choice as a violation of the GDPR in Europe, while Tesla maintains that the equipment complies with the legislation. Which standpoint is correct ultimately depends on one specific detail: whether the cameras record continuously or only when an incident occurs. This Tesla case is useful because it highlights a dilemma: New technologies enable innovative use cases that can benefit users but they can also stray into legal territory that can be difficult to navigate. It can be easy to violate a requirement without behaving negligently and without even the slightest intention of doing so.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Systematic Approach to Data Protection</h2>



<p>Given the influence of the GDPR, compliance is essential in any sustainable and responsible digital transformation. Intensifying existing data protection measures is a useful step that manufacturers can take immediately. The question is, what measures are most effective? Companies can provide the foundations for successful and sustainable data protection by establishing a team with the necessary authority and responsibility for managing data protection. This team needs to have two main objectives: Firstly, to integrate data protection requirements into the existing process landscape. Secondly, to raise awareness of data protection requirements throughout the company. This can be achieved through tailored employee training, communication concepts, and audit processes.</p>



<p>Digital transformation is rapidly increasing the amount of data available and offers enormous potential for the German economy. The German Federal Government has already recognized this and has set up a platform called the Mobility Data Space for German automotive companies to exchange traffic data. The intention is to give Germany a competitive edge in the field of modern mobility, but also to pave the way for the next stage of industrialization – Industry 5.0. Earlier this year, the European Union described the objectives of Industry 5.0 as a more sustainable, resilient, and human-centric industry. The pressure on companies will increase once again to ensure that they process personal data not only per the law but also ethically.</p>



<p>Achieving this ambitious goal is only possible by taking into account existing data protection requirements, European rules of business, and ethical considerations, which will be the main challenge for everyone involved.</p>
