<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/5g-tsn-automotive-connectivity/">5G-TSN Integration: The Future of Automotive Connectivity</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The automotive industry is at the precipice of a transformative shift, driven by the powerful synergy of&nbsp;<strong>5G technology</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</strong>. This groundbreaking fusion, known as&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>, promises to redefine how vehicles communicate, ensuring unparalleled levels of safety, efficiency, and intelligence. By merging the high-speed, flexible capabilities of 5G with the ultra-reliable, low-latency guarantees of TSN, we are moving towards a future where vehicles are not just connected, but seamlessly integrated into a larger, dynamic ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-1">Key Insights into 5G-TSN Integration</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deterministic Communication:</strong>&nbsp;5G-TSN integration provides the critical ability to guarantee timely data delivery, essential for safety-critical automotive functions like autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</li>



<li><strong>Seamless V2X Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;This integration extends real-time, reliable communication beyond the vehicle, enabling robust Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions, which are crucial for coordinated maneuvers and traffic management.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced In-Vehicle Networking:</strong>&nbsp;By consolidating diverse communication buses onto a unified Ethernet-based network, 5G-TSN integration simplifies vehicle architecture, reduces complexity, and supports the evolving demands of software-defined vehicles.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-2">The Core of 5G-TSN Integration: A Technological Deep Dive</h2>



<p>At its heart,&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;is about combining the best of both worlds: the wireless prowess of 5G and the wired precision of TSN. 5G, the fifth generation of wireless communication, brings immense bandwidth, ultra-low latency (often less than 1 millisecond in ideal conditions), and the capacity to connect a massive number of devices simultaneously. These attributes are vital for external vehicle communication, cloud services, and real-time data exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, TSN is a suite of IEEE Ethernet standards designed to provide deterministic communication. This means guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency (often below 100 microseconds with jitter less than 1 microsecond), and highly reliable data transfer, even under heavy network load. TSN is particularly critical for time-sensitive applications within the vehicle, where every microsecond counts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="758" height="625" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5064" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png 758w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-300x247.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This radar chart illustrates the complementary strengths of 5G and TSN, highlighting how their integration covers a broader spectrum of essential networking attributes for automotive applications.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Industrial Use Cases</strong> (For Automotive OEMs)</h2>



<p>A modern, future-ready industrial network typically operates across three main connectivity layers, as illustrated in Figure 1.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1495" height="842" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5068" style="width:1241px;height:auto" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png 1495w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-300x169.png 300w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-1024x577.png 1024w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1495px) 100vw, 1495px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">TSN in a Factory
Figure 1: Example of TSN deployment in a factory setting</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the <strong>central management layer</strong>, the vehicle manufacturer’s backend systems—or an automotive edge cloud—host key control, management, and data processing functions. This layer communicates with fleets, connected infrastructure, and service platforms.</p>



<p>At the <strong>vehicle domain level</strong>, different domains such as the powertrain, chassis, infotainment, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are interconnected. Each domain contains electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, and actuators. The <strong>TSN backbone</strong> inside the vehicle provides deterministic transport services both between domains and from domains to the central management layer.</p>



<p>Within a domain, <strong>Controller-to-Device (C2D)</strong> communication ensures that safety-critical commands—such as braking, steering adjustments, or adaptive suspension settings—are executed in real time. This is comparable to <em>Stream C</em> in industrial setups. When domains need to coordinate—such as chassis and powertrain for stability control—<strong>Controller-to-Controller (C2C)</strong> communication (<em>Stream B</em>) is used, requiring equally stringent timing guarantees.</p>



<p>Some data flows are less time-sensitive but still essential, such as telemetry uploads, diagnostics, and over-the-air updates. This <strong>Device-to-Compute (D2Cmp)</strong> communication (<em>Stream A</em>) typically moves from in-vehicle sensors to cloud servers or OEM analytics platforms.</p>



<p>In a <strong>software-defined vehicle</strong> architecture, control functions are no longer bound to specific hardware ECUs. Instead, they can be virtualized in an automotive edge cloud. For example, <em>Stream D</em> could represent a vehicle function—like energy management—being controlled from the cloud. Likewise, <em>Stream E</em> could represent real-time coordination between multiple virtualized control functions across a connected vehicle fleet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-3">Why 5G-TSN Integration is a Game-Changer for Automotive</h2>



<p>The modern vehicle is an increasingly complex, software-defined machine. Features like ADAS and autonomous driving demand communication networks that are not only fast but also incredibly precise and predictable. This is where&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;proves indispensable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Achieving Deterministic Communication</h3>



<p>TSN ensures that critical data, such as emergency braking commands or sensor fusion outputs, is delivered within a guaranteed timeframe, even during periods of heavy data traffic. This deterministic behavior is vital for safety-critical systems where delays could have catastrophic consequences. By extending these guarantees via 5G, the vehicle can maintain real-time capabilities even when communicating with external entities, such as infrastructure or other vehicles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enabling Seamless Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication</h3>



<p><strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;is foundational for robust V2X communication, encompassing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) interactions. This enables real-time hazard warnings, optimized traffic flow, and cooperative maneuvers between autonomous vehicles, significantly improving road safety and efficiency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-4">Key Technologies Driving 5G-TSN Integration</h2>



<p>Several key technologies underpin the successful integration of 5G and TSN in automotive environments:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>3GPP Standards:</strong>&nbsp;Specifically, Release 16 and beyond incorporate features that enable 5G systems to act as logical TSN bridges. This allows for seamless interoperability between wired TSN networks within vehicles and the wireless 5G network, ensuring data integrity and timing synchronization across domains.</li>



<li><strong>Precision Time Protocol (PTP):</strong>&nbsp;PTP (IEEE 802.1AS) is crucial for synchronizing devices within the vehicle network with microsecond accuracy. This level of synchronization is essential for coordinated sensor data processing, control decisions, and ensuring that all components operate on a common time reference.</li>



<li><strong>Switched Ethernet Architectures:</strong>&nbsp;Moving away from shared bus systems to switched Ethernet within the vehicle ensures deterministic, lossless packet delivery, which is a prerequisite for advanced autonomous driving functions.</li>



<li><strong>TSN Bridging (DS-TT and NW-TT):</strong>&nbsp;These components facilitate the seamless handoff of time-sensitive data between the TSN domain and the 5G core network, preserving timing guarantees across wired and wireless segments.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-7">Challenges and the Path Forward</h2>



<p>While the advantages of&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;are compelling, several challenges remain. Ensuring widespread 5G network coverage, particularly in diverse geographical areas, is a significant undertaking. Addressing complex cybersecurity threats in a highly interconnected automotive ecosystem is paramount. Furthermore, establishing global standards and ensuring seamless interoperability between different vendors and technologies will be crucial for mass adoption.</p>



<p>However, industry leaders and organizations like the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) are actively collaborating to overcome these hurdles. The continuous evolution of 3GPP standards (like Release 17 and beyond) and ongoing prototype development demonstrate a clear path towards widespread deployment. As 5G infrastructure expands and TSN capabilities mature, we can expect increasingly sophisticated and connected automotive solutions that enhance safety, efficiency, and user experience, ultimately shaping the future of mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern vehicles are essentially computers on wheels, with dozens of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and millions of lines of software code. This connectivity, from GPS and infotainment to V2X and over-the-air updates, makes <strong>automotive cybersecurity</strong> critical. Hackers can target vehicle networks to steal personal data or even hijack vehicle controls. A dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) for automotive systems continuously monitors vehicle traffic, telematics servers, and cloud services 24/7 to detect and respond to these threats in real time. In this article, we explain what an automotive SOC does, why it’s essential for modern vehicles, and the key benefits it provides.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a SOC in Automotive Cybersecurity?</h2>



<p>A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team and platform for monitoring and managing security threats. In the automotive world, a <strong>Vehicle SOC (VSOC)</strong> extends this concept to cars and connected mobility. According to security experts, “a SOC is a team that deals with security issues” at a technical level, using dedicated tools to constantly monitor an organization’s IT and network infrastructure. A Vehicle SOC does the same but also watches over the car-specific components – everything from the <strong>connected vehicle cloud</strong> and fleet management systems to the vehicles themselves, including on-board sensors and radars. In effect, an automotive SOC acts as the cybersecurity command center for a manufacturer or fleet, aggregating data from vehicle ECUs, telematics units, and cloud services to detect anomalies and incidents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-683x1024.webp" alt="Key components of an automotive Security Operations Center." class="wp-image-4818" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-683x1024.webp 683w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-200x300.webp 200w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-768x1152.webp 768w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center.webp 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Key components of an automotive Security Operations Center.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The diagram above illustrates a typical SOC architecture. A SOC ingests data logs (from ECUs, on-board networks, and cloud connectors), aggregates and correlates events, and applies threat intelligence. Security analysts or automated tools then triage alerts and trigger incident response actions. As <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/security-operations-centre#:~:text=What%27s%20a%20SOC%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Thales</a> puts it, a SOC is “the command center for identifying emerging cybersecurity threats and responding immediately to mitigate risk”. By centralizing visibility across the entire connected vehicle ecosystem, a SOC can quickly spot malicious behavior, for example, abnormal network packets or unauthorized firmware changes, and contain them before they affect the vehicle or backend systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cybersecurity Threats to Connected Vehicles</h2>



<p>Today’s vehicles are “rolling data centers,” connected to multiple networks. This connectivity brings convenience but also exposes vehicles to cyberattacks. Common threats in the automotive landscape include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vehicle Hacking:</strong> Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ECUs or V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) links to manipulate car functions (e.g., engine, brakes, or locks).</li>



<li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Personal information and telemetry data stored in cloud services or in-vehicle systems can be stolen or leaked.</li>



<li><strong>Ransomware Attacks:</strong> Cybercriminals may encrypt or lock down a vehicle’s systems (infotainment, telematics, etc.) and demand payment to restore access.</li>



<li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Malicious code can be introduced during software updates or through compromised components in the vehicle supply chain.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/secure-futures-magazine/vehicle-security-operations-center/36596/#:~:text=Operating%20systems%20in%20connected%20vehicles,the%20consequences%20could%20be%20devastating" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Kaspersky Security</a> warns that if a hacker “remotely hijacks the operating system of one of your vehicles,” the consequences could be devastating. Given these risks, automotive manufacturers and fleet operators need robust monitoring and quick response capabilities. A SOC provides this 24/7 vigilance, acting like a security watchdog for every network and device in the connected car domain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Benefits of SOC in Automotive Cybersecurity</h2>



<p>Implementing an automotive SOC brings several important advantages:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Continuous Threat Detection:</strong> A SOC continuously scans vehicle networks and cloud infrastructure for anomalies. Horizon Connect notes that an SOC service offers “round-the-clock monitoring to detect and respond to threats in real time”. This means suspicious signals in the data flow – like unusual commands sent to an ECU or abnormal login attempts – are caught immediately.</li>



<li><strong>Rapid Incident Response:</strong> When a threat is detected, the SOC team can act instantly to isolate and contain it. This might involve cutting off a hacked vehicle from the fleet network or rolling out an emergency update. Quick response “prevents downtime” and minimizes impact on drivers and manufacturers. Thales emphasizes that uninterrupted monitoring by an SOC “improves response times when security issues occur,” reducing damage and costs.</li>



<li><strong>Centralized Visibility:</strong> A dedicated automotive SOC provides a single pane of glass for the entire vehicle ecosystem. It correlates data from ECUs, mobile apps, infrastructure sensors, and more. By centralizing this visibility, it becomes much easier to spot patterns of attack that span multiple vehicles or systems. For example, an SOC can detect if a batch of cars suddenly tries to contact a suspicious IP address.</li>



<li><strong>Threat Intelligence &amp; Analytics:</strong> Modern SOCs leverage AI and machine learning to predict and prevent attacks. As Horizon Connect highlights, SOC platforms use “AI-driven analytics to predict and neutralize attacks before they occur”. This proactive intelligence is crucial for automotive cybersecurity, where new malware or attack methods can emerge rapidly.</li>



<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Many countries now mandate automotive cybersecurity standards (e.g., UNECE WP.29, ISO/SAE 21434). A SOC helps meet these requirements by continuously monitoring and documenting cyber risks. Detailed reporting from a SOC makes it easier to show regulators that security measures are in place and up-to-date.</li>
</ul>



<p>These benefits make a SOC a foundational element of a mature automotive cybersecurity strategy. Figure [11] (above) highlights components like log collection, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and threat intelligence feeds that together enable these capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing an Automotive SOC</h2>



<p>Building an effective Vehicle SOC can be done in-house or by outsourcing to experts. Some large OEMs and fleet operators establish their own VSOCs, while others partner with specialized cybersecurity firms (offering “SOC as a Service”). Regardless of the approach, key steps include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integrate Vehicle Data Streams:</strong> Ensure that all vehicle and network logs (from telematics, diagnostic sensors, mobile apps, etc.) feed into the SOC’s monitoring platform. This may involve deploying onboard intrusion detection systems or cloud agents to collect telemetry.</li>



<li><strong>Develop Incident Playbooks:</strong> Prepare response procedures for different scenarios (e.g., remote takeover attempts, data breach, malware outbreak). Analysts should know how to escalate issues and whom to notify in each case. As one expert notes, escalating vehicle monitoring alerts straight to the SOC is critical for quick remediation.</li>



<li><strong>Leverage Threat Intelligence:</strong> Subscribe to multiple threat feeds (from industry groups, security vendors, etc.) and continuously update the SOC’s knowledge base. Correlating external intelligence with vehicle behavior helps spot known attack patterns.</li>



<li><strong>Regular Training and Testing:</strong> SOC analysts need specialized training on automotive systems, which differ from IT networks. Regular drills and penetration tests (e.g., red-team exercises on vehicles) help ensure the SOC is ready. Horizon Connect also recommends fuzz testing and white-hat hacking programs to find vulnerabilities before adversaries do.</li>
</ol>



<p>In some cases, vehicles can even report their own issues to the SOC. For example, onboard modules might automatically flag unusual commands or sensor readings back to the SOC dashboard. This feeds the SOC with richer data to analyze. Ultimately, whether run internally or by a vendor, the goal of the SOC is the same: “minimize the chances of a cybersecurity breach” across your entire fleet, so engineers can focus on building the future of transport.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Connected-vehicle-network.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4819" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Connected-vehicle-network.webp 1024w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Connected-vehicle-network-300x300.webp 300w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Connected-vehicle-network-150x150.webp 150w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Connected-vehicle-network-768x768.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The graphic above illustrates a typical connected vehicle ecosystem. Each interface (cellular, V2X, OTA updates, Bluetooth) can be an entry point for attackers. A SOC in <strong>automotive cybersecurity</strong> monitors all these links and internal vehicle networks. For instance, if a car’s infotainment unit suddenly transmits data to an unknown server, the SOC would generate an alert for analysts to investigate. By correlating data from hundreds or thousands of vehicles, the SOC can identify even subtle threats (such as malware that only activates under certain conditions).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>As vehicles become increasingly software-driven and networked, SOCs are no longer optional – they are essential for keeping drivers and data safe. A well-designed Security Operations Center provides continuous oversight of car networks, enabling fast threat detection, incident response, and compliance with evolving regulations. <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Horizon Connect</a> specializes in automotive SOC solutions and offers SOC-as-a-Service to help manufacturers and fleet operators protect their connected vehicles.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Discover the key CAN Bus limitations and why modern connected vehicles need Ethernet-based architectures for advanced mobility.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/can-bus-limitations-connected-vehicles/">Why CAN Bus Isn’t Enough for Modern Vehicles</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As vehicle technology evolves rapidly, the <strong>CAN Bus limitations</strong> are becoming more apparent. Originally developed in the 1980s, the Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus was designed for simple, low-bandwidth tasks like engine control or window operations. But today’s connected vehicles are essentially data centers on wheels, and CAN can’t keep up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CAN Bus: A Reliable Workhorse, But Not Future-Ready</h2>



<p>The <strong>CAN Bus</strong> protocol has served the automotive industry well, enabling efficient communication between ECUs (Electronic Control Units). However, the rise of <strong>connected mobility</strong>, <strong>over-the-air updates</strong>, <strong>advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)</strong>, and <strong>real-time telematics</strong> has exposed the <strong>CAN Bus limitations</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key CAN Bus Limitations in Today’s Connected Cars</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Bandwidth Constraints</strong></h3>



<p>CAN Bus supports up to 1 Mbps. Today’s vehicles exchange gigabytes of data per day, especially with 360° cameras, radar sensors, LiDAR, and V2X communication. High-bandwidth systems like <strong>Automotive Ethernet</strong> (up to 10 Gbps) are now critical to support:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Real-time traffic updates</li>



<li>Remote diagnostics</li>



<li>Infotainment streaming</li>



<li>Firmware updates over-the-air (FOTA)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Security Challenges and Cyber Risks</strong></h3>



<p>CAN Bus lacks encryption and authentication, making it vulnerable to cyberattacks. In contrast, modern architectures support security protocols like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>MACsec for Ethernet</li>



<li>Secure boot and encryption</li>



<li>Intrusion detection systems (IDS)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Latency &amp; Prioritization Issues for Critical Systems</strong></h3>



<p>ADAS, emergency braking, and autonomous driving features require <strong>real-time, low-latency</strong> communication. CAN Bus operates on a priority arbitration system that isn’t fast or reliable enough for life-critical tasks. Ethernet-based TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) is the preferred alternative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Lack of Scalability in Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV)</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">CAN Bus</a> cannot support the <strong>software-defined vehicle (SDV)</strong> architecture being adopted by leading automakers. SDV relies on centralized computing platforms, unified data buses, and modular service deployment, none of which are feasible over traditional CAN.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Forward: Ethernet, LIN, and Next-Gen Architectures</h2>



<p>Modern vehicles now combine different communication technologies depending on the application:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Communication Protocol</th><th>Speed</th><th>Application</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CAN / CAN FD</td><td>1-5 Mbps</td><td>Powertrain, basic controls</td></tr><tr><td>LIN</td><td>20 Kbps</td><td>Non-critical components (e.g., seats)</td></tr><tr><td>FlexRay</td><td>10 Mbps</td><td>Time-critical systems (legacy use)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Automotive Ethernet</strong></td><td><strong>100 Mbps – 10 Gbps</strong></td><td><strong>Infotainment, ADAS, OTA, V2X</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Real-World Impacts of CAN Bus Limitations</h2>



<p>For OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers, clinging to CAN-based frameworks hinders product innovation and market competitiveness.</p>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>OTA updates may fail or take hours due to limited bandwidth</li>



<li>ADAS may experience latency due to lack of deterministic communication</li>



<li>Cybersecurity compliance (e.g., UNECE WP.29) becomes more complex and costly</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: The Shift Beyond CAN Bus Is Inevitable</h2>



<p>The <strong>CAN Bus limitations</strong> are holding back innovation in connected vehicles. To unlock the full potential of smart mobility, automakers and Tier-1 suppliers must invest in <strong>high-bandwidth</strong>, <strong>secure</strong>, and <strong>low-latency</strong> alternatives like <strong>Automotive Ethernet</strong> and <strong>TSN</strong>. The road ahead is clear: it&#8217;s time to evolve beyond the CAN Bus.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Discover why eCall in connected vehicles is critical for safer, faster emergency response and the future of smart mobility.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/ecall-in-connected-vehicles/">Why eCall is Essential for Smart, Connected Mobility</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age of smart mobility, <strong>eCall in connected vehicles</strong> is no longer a luxury—it’s a life-saving necessity. Designed to instantly alert emergency services during severe accidents, eCall systems are transforming road safety and becoming a key component of the global push for intelligent transportation systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is eCall and How Does It Work?</h2>



<p>eCall (short for “emergency call”) is an automatic crash notification system. When a vehicle equipped with eCall detects a serious collision, it automatically initiates a call to emergency services (e.g., 112 in Europe). Alongside this voice call, a <strong>Minimum Set of Data (MSD)</strong> is sent—sharing the vehicle’s exact GPS location, time of the crash, vehicle ID (VIN), and direction of travel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="2000" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process.jpg" alt="eCall process from crash detection, data transmission, to emergency response dispatch" class="wp-image-4573" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process.jpg 2000w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process-300x300.jpg 300w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process-150x150.jpg 150w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process-768x768.jpg 768w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eCall-process-1536x1536.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">eCall process from crash detection, data transmission, to emergency response dispatch</figcaption></figure>



<p>eCall systems also allow manual activation via a <strong>dashboard SOS button</strong>. And even if the car’s battery is damaged, a backup power supply ensures the emergency call is completed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global eCall Mandates and Safety Standards</h2>



<p>The European Union was the first to legislate eCall: since March 2018, all new cars sold in the EU must be equipped with the technology. Other countries including Japan, India, Russia, and members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), have followed suit with similar regulations. Notably, <strong>Saudi Arabia has announced that all new light-duty vehicles imported into the Kingdom must be equipped with eCall systems starting January 1, 2027</strong>, as outlined in the SASO 2944:2023 standard. This regulation forms part of the country&#8217;s broader Vision 2030 strategy to enhance road safety and modernize transportation infrastructure. These global mandates reinforce the growing importance of <strong>eCall in connected vehicles</strong> as a standard for safer, smarter mobility.</p>



<p><strong>These mandates reflect eCall’s proven impact:</strong> studies show it can cut emergency response times by up to 50%, saving approximately 2,500 lives annually in the EU alone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">eCall vs. Traditional Emergency Systems</h2>



<p>Traditional emergency response relies on passengers or bystanders calling emergency services—a method that fails if occupants are unconscious or unsure of their location.</p>



<p><strong>eCall eliminates that delay</strong> by providing:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Automatic crash detection</li>



<li>Precise GPS-based location sharing</li>



<li>Immediate voice/data link with emergency responders</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a proactive solution designed for critical minutes when human action may be impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How eCall Fits into Smart Mobility Ecosystems</h2>



<p>Modern vehicles are built around advanced telematics, and eCall is fully integrated with that architecture. Connected vehicles use <strong>eSIMs, 4G/5G, and edge computing</strong> to enhance safety and communication. eCall is now evolving with these technologies into <strong>Next-Generation eCall</strong> (NG-eCall), enabling richer data exchange (e.g., passenger count, sensor health, even real-time video).</p>



<p>In the future, eCall will work seamlessly with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>V2X communication</strong> (car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure)</li>



<li><strong>AI-based risk prediction</strong></li>
