Designed to instantly alert emergency services during severe accidents, eCall systems are transforming road safety and becoming a key component of the global push for intelligent transportation systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is eCall and How Does It Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>eCall (short for \u201cemergency call\u201d) is an automatic crash notification system. When a vehicle equipped with eCall detects a serious collision, it automatically initiates a call to emergency services (e.g., 112 in Europe). Alongside this voice call, a <strong>Minimum Set of Data (MSD)<\/strong> is sent\u2014sharing the vehicle\u2019s exact GPS location, time of the crash, vehicle ID (VIN), and direction of travel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process.jpg\" alt=\"eCall process from crash detection, data transmission, to emergency response dispatch\" class=\"wp-image-4573\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/eCall-process-1536x1536.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">eCall process from crash detection, data transmission, to emergency response dispatch<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>eCall systems also allow manual activation via a <strong>dashboard SOS button<\/strong>. And even if the car\u2019s battery is damaged, a backup power supply ensures the emergency call is completed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Global eCall Mandates and Safety Standards<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The European Union was the first to legislate eCall: since March 2018, all new cars sold in the EU must be equipped with the technology. Other countries including Japan, India, Russia, and members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), have followed suit with similar regulations. Notably, <strong>Saudi Arabia has announced that all new light-duty vehicles imported into the Kingdom must be equipped with eCall systems starting January 1, 2027<\/strong>, as outlined in the SASO 2944:2023 standard. This regulation forms part of the country&#8217;s broader Vision 2030 strategy to enhance road safety and modernize transportation infrastructure. These global mandates reinforce the growing importance of <strong>eCall in connected vehicles<\/strong> as a standard for safer, smarter mobility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These mandates reflect eCall\u2019s proven impact:<\/strong> studies show it can cut emergency response times by up to 50%, saving approximately 2,500 lives annually in the EU alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">eCall vs. Traditional Emergency Systems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional emergency response relies on passengers or bystanders calling emergency services\u2014a method that fails if occupants are unconscious or unsure of their location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>eCall eliminates that delay<\/strong> by providing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Automatic crash detection<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Precise GPS-based location sharing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Immediate voice\/data link with emergency responders<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a proactive solution designed for critical minutes when human action may be impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How eCall Fits into Smart Mobility Ecosystems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern vehicles are built around advanced telematics, and eCall is fully integrated with that architecture. Connected vehicles use <strong>eSIMs, 4G\/5G, and edge computing<\/strong> to enhance safety and communication. eCall is now evolving with these technologies into <strong>Next-Generation eCall<\/strong> (NG-eCall), enabling richer data exchange (e.g., passenger count, sensor health, even real-time video).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, eCall will work seamlessly with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>V2X communication<\/strong> (car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AI-based risk prediction<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Smart city platforms<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rohde-schwarz.com\/ch-en\/solutions\/automotive-testing\/automotive-connectivity-and-infotainment\/poster-the-evolution-of-ecall_257505.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"How eCall Has Evolved in Automotive Connectivity\" class=\"wp-image-4579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/05\/automotive-connectivity-the-evolution-of-ecall-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">How eCall Has Evolved in Automotive Connectivity<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OEM Adoption: Spotlight on Volkswagen Group<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volkswagen.de\/de.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Volkswagen Group<\/a> has implemented eCall across its brands\u2014VW, Audi, Skoda, SEAT, and Porsche. eCall comes standard in all new VW models, meeting and exceeding EU safety mandates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tier-one suppliers like Bosch also enable VW Group to integrate cloud-based eCall services, offering real-time vehicle data to emergency centers.
