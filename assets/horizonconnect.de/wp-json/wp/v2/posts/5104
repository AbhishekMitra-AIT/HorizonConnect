At the center of this shift is <strong>C-V2X Direct<\/strong>, a breakthrough in direct vehicle communication that eliminates the need for cellular networks when every millisecond counts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>C-V2X Direct, standardized by 3GPP and championed by the 5G Automotive Association (<a href=\"https:\/\/5gaa.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">5GAA<\/a>), is designed to enable <strong>ultra-low-latency, real-time communication<\/strong> between vehicles (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and pedestrians or cyclists (V2P). With deployments already happening in Asia, North America, and Europe, this technology is set to become the foundation of global road safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Horizon Connect, we help <strong>automotive OEMs and mobility providers<\/strong> adopt C-V2X Direct by integrating it seamlessly into broader IoT connectivity strategies. Our solutions ensure vehicles are globally connected, secure, and ready to meet the demands of modern mobility\u2014anywhere, anytime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is C-V2X Direct?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C-V2X<\/strong> stands for <em>Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything<\/em>, and it operates in two main modes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>C-V2X Direct (PC5 interface):<\/strong><br>This enables direct communication between vehicles, roadside units, and pedestrians\u2019 devices\u2014without going through a cellular network. It uses the <strong>5.9 GHz ITS band<\/strong> for ultra-reliable, short-range messages that are crucial for safety.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>C-V2X Network (Uu interface):<\/strong><br>This mode relies on 4G\/5G cellular networks for cloud-based services such as navigation, telematics, and over-the-air (OTA) updates.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>PC5 interface<\/strong> is what makes C-V2X Direct revolutionary. By bypassing cellular networks, it ensures that critical safety messages\u2014like sudden braking alerts, pedestrian detection, or intersection collision warnings\u2014are transmitted in <strong>under 20 milliseconds<\/strong>. This is significantly faster than human reaction time, and it works even in areas with poor network coverage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/5gaa.org\/5g-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1456\" src=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-scaled.png\" alt=\"Diagram of V2X communication modes showing direct PC5 interface for V2V, V2I, and V2P safety messaging, and Uu network interface for V2N cloud services.\" class=\"wp-image-5109\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-scaled.png 2560w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-1024x582.png 1024w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-768x437.png 768w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-1536x874.png 1536w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/Figure-1-\u2013-V2X-Communication-Modes-2048x1165.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Figure 1 \u2013 V2X Communication Modes <a href=\"https:\/\/5gaa.org\/5g-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">(Source 5GAA)<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the PC5 Interface Works<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The PC5 interface is a <strong>sidelink communication channel<\/strong>. Vehicles equipped with C-V2X Direct broadcast information up to 10 times per second, creating a <strong>real-time safety bubble<\/strong> around them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key technical aspects include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Autonomous Resource Allocation:<\/strong> Each vehicle senses available radio slots and transmits without network scheduling. This ensures reliability even in dense traffic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Global Spectrum Allocation:<\/strong> Many regions have already allocated the 5.9 GHz band for ITS safety, making C-V2X Direct viable globally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Always-On Capability:<\/strong> Messages are exchanged without requiring SIM cards, mobile coverage, or infrastructure support\u2014ideal for emergency scenarios.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability for 5G NR-V2X:<\/strong> With future 5G releases, PC5 will support even more advanced use cases, including sensor sharing and cooperative driving maneuvers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, C-V2X Direct equips vehicles with <strong>instant situational awareness<\/strong>, which can mean the difference between a safe trip and a collision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why C-V2X Direct Matters for Road Safety<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The real strength of C-V2X Direct lies in its ability to enable <strong>life-saving applications<\/strong> that were previously impossible or unreliable with legacy technologies like DSRC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Collision Avoidance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine two cars approaching an intersection at high speed. One driver fails to stop at a red light. With C-V2X Direct, both cars exchange trajectory data instantly, and the system warns the drivers\u2014or intervenes automatically\u2014to avoid a crash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5GAA demonstrations have already shown how <strong>Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL)<\/strong> warnings are transmitted in milliseconds, giving trailing cars the chance to react long before human reflexes would kick in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyclists and pedestrians are among the most at risk on busy roads. C-V2X Direct can connect their devices (such as smartphones or helmets) directly to nearby vehicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one high-profile demo, Audi showcased how C-V2X Direct alerts drivers to hidden cyclists at intersections. Similarly, Autotalks tested VRU detection where a car automatically slowed after receiving an alert about a cyclist outside the driver\u2019s field of view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Emergency Vehicle Priority<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles often lose precious seconds navigating through traffic. With C-V2X Direct, they can broadcast their presence directly to surrounding cars, which automatically receive warnings and clear a path\u2014even before lights and sirens are noticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5GAA\u2019s Atlanta \u201cDay One Deployment District\u201d showcased how emergency vehicles could reliably pre-empt traffic signals and warn nearby cars, reducing response times dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Road Infrastructure Integration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traffic signals and roadside sensors can also communicate via C-V2X Direct. Use cases include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Red Light Violation Warning (RLVW):<\/strong> Alerts drivers if they\u2019re about to run a red light.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Road Works Warning (RWW):<\/strong> Notifies vehicles of upcoming construction zones.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA):<\/strong> Helps drivers adjust speed to catch a green wave.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These applications not only improve safety but also reduce congestion and emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Global Deployment Roadmap of C-V2X Direct<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>C-V2X Direct is no longer a future vision\u2014it is actively being deployed worldwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>China:<\/strong> Since 2020, multiple OEMs have launched C-V2X-equipped models. Over 90 cities and 5,000 km of smart roads support C-V2X with roadside units.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Europe:<\/strong> EU projects like C-Roads and 5G corridors are preparing infrastructure. Mass deployment of <strong>C-V2X Direct is projected between 2026\u20132029<\/strong>, starting with major transport corridors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>North America:<\/strong> In 2020, the FCC reserved 30 MHz of spectrum for C-V2X. By 2025, live deployment districts like Atlanta have already demonstrated real-world use cases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By <strong>2030<\/strong>, industry roadmaps predict hundreds of millions of vehicles globally will be equipped with C-V2X Direct, enabling a truly cooperative transport ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/5gaa.org\/5g-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"835\" src=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/figure-2-globally-expected-timelines-for-mass-deployment-of-advanced-connected-vehicle-use-cases.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5111\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/figure-2-globally-expected-timelines-for-mass-deployment-of-advanced-connected-vehicle-use-cases.webp 1536w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/figure-2-globally-expected-timelines-for-mass-deployment-of-advanced-connected-vehicle-use-cases-300x163.webp 300w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/figure-2-globally-expected-timelines-for-mass-deployment-of-advanced-connected-vehicle-use-cases-1024x557.webp 1024w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/09\/figure-2-globally-expected-timelines-for-mass-deployment-of-advanced-connected-vehicle-use-cases-768x418.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure 2 \u2013\u00a0Roadmap of deployment of advanced connected vehicles use cases &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/5gaa.org\/5g-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">(Source 5GAA)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>C-V2X Direct is more than just another automotive technology\u2014it\u2019s a <strong>game-changer for global road safety<\/strong>.
