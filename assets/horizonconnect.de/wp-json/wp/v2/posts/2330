Like Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), this topic requires urgent action. For this reason, rather than discussing the specific topics covered by CDR again, this article is an appeal to act on this issue and not leave it as late as we have done with sustainability. Do not wait until significant and irreparable damage has already been done. The question is: Are we willing and able to learn from the mistakes of the past? The idea of consuming less today to continue living tomorrow seems to be an unappealing prospect for many. An entire generation of adults has utterly failed this \u201cmarshmallow test.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Bad Deal: Data for Services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digitalization is now becoming a beacon of hope for achieving a more sustainable future. Perhaps going without is not the only way to relieve the burden on people, animals, and the environment. However, besides offering the world many undeniable advantages and opportunities, digitalization \u2013 like industrialization \u2013 also represents some considerable disadvantages and risks. The Internet, now an integral part of our daily lives, maybe the best example of this. As in the early days of the barter economy, we exchange our data for any number of services. More and more people are now realizing that these services that appear free of charge come at a cost after all. Yet the vast majority of users still do not know the true value of their data. If you trade your digital sovereignty for free access to Facebook, you are making a bad deal and giving away gold in exchange for nothing but a few colorful glass beads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, the scale of the problem is widely underestimated. For a long time now, the issue has extended beyond our data being collected unnoticed when we visit a website and then sold in auctions within milliseconds so that other companies can understand us better and predict our behavior. We are now being actively influenced to behave in a certain way. These activities are facilitated by comprehensive findings from scientific behavioral research, which form the basis of \u201cbehavior design\u201d in the economy. As unflattering as it sounds, our reward system works in the same way as that of the pigeons and rats conditioned by the behavioral scientist B. F. Skinner. Anyone who believes that they navigate through the Internet of their own accord is sorely mistaken. Unfortunately for us, our reward system craves validation, which is why we are all obsessed with clicks and likes on Facebook and LinkedIn. The higher the numbers, the more dopamine our brains receive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Danger to Societies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is not only our sovereignty and our consumer behavior that is put at risk by this principle. It is becoming a serious threat to entire societies. Despotic states, unscrupulous interest groups, and international organized crime gangs have waged war on the free democratic world for many years. Fervent social media users have their opinions reinforced \u2013 and are rewarded \u2013 by feedback loops. The bubble created around these users becomes increasingly impervious. These issues can only be counteracted by all stakeholders taking a coherent approach. And this includes companies \u2013 they must wholeheartedly accept their digital responsibility!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim extends far beyond a fair data economy or hate- and manipulation-free Internet. The concept of CDR applies both to risks and opportunities. According to our definition, \u201cCDR is about building trust and managing the trade-offs of digitalization.\u201d For example, digitalization can make a significant contribution to 70 percent of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. Digital technologies have the potential to reduce Germany\u2019s emissions by more than half of the total reductions needed. However, it is important to recognize that digitalization also offers Germany the opportunity to ensure that it retains a leading position in the global economy. Policy-makers and economists, therefore, have a responsibility to fully exploit the available potential and in doing so champion a triple-bottom-line framework.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We view CDR as a consistent development or indispensable extension of CSR. It is the logical consequence of the analog industrial and digital tech worlds converging. The illustration shows a simplified, clear depiction of the approach. In the \u201cold\u201d world, responsibility ended at the point we call \u201cfirst use,\u201d i.e. the point where products became the property of customers. Today, responsibility extends far beyond that point because digital technologies mean that companies remain permanently connected to their products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"890\" height=\"406\" src=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Five-Ideas-for-Integrating-Corporate-Digital-Responsibility-into-Corporate-Strategy-figure.webp\" alt=\"Five Ideas for Integrating Corporate Digital Responsibility into Corporate Strategy figure\" class=\"wp-image-2332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Five-Ideas-for-Integrating-Corporate-Digital-Responsibility-into-Corporate-Strategy-figure.webp 890w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Five-Ideas-for-Integrating-Corporate-Digital-Responsibility-into-Corporate-Strategy-figure-300x137.webp 300w, https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Five-Ideas-for-Integrating-Corporate-Digital-Responsibility-into-Corporate-Strategy-figure-768x350.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Time to Act!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time for responsibility to also be reassessed within companies. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to be the key factor that determines whether or not an entire economy will continue to be successful, not just an individual company. In this context, being successful means being prepared for disruption of the labor market and protecting basic democratic principles, and establishing human rights against the possibilities of AI misuse. AI can threaten human dignity in the same way that climate change can threaten life itself. The EU has now recognized this issue and produced the first legally binding framework on ethics and AI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several other important aspects of corporate digital responsibility that I could outline here but instead, I am initiating a call to action. Since the 1980s, we have been certain that climate change will happen, that it is a man-made problem, and we have known what devastating effects it will have. Nevertheless, over the last forty years, we have taken barely any action, and we have even knowingly made the situation worse. In the case of digitalization, things are moving much faster. The industry giants already control our every move in the virtual arena. We cannot and must not allow ourselves to make the same mistake again and let decades pass without taking action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Five Ideas for Corporate Responsibility<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSR and CDR are inextricably linked and require action as equally urgent issues under the umbrella of corporate responsibility. So what can be done?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies can base their actions on these five ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Act now and define goals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with a workshop and familiarize yourself with the concept of CDR.<br>Identify potential project stakeholders.<br>Define rough initial goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Determine relevance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Establish a project.<br>Determine which CDR topics are relevant to your company.<br>Prioritize these topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Map out CSR activities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Align CSR activities and strategy with the CDR topics that you have identified.<br>Pinpoint synergies and define a consolidated corporate responsibility strategy.<br>As part of this step, define your new corporate citizenship strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Create a roadmap based on the Pareto principle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a roadmap that prioritizes immediate action. Applying the Pareto principle is a good approach.<br>Define clear responsibilities that are not limited by field or role.<br>Keep in mind that change management will be an important success factor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Anchor this topic as a competitive factor in the corporate strategy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine digitalization and sustainability into a single major transformation. These topics should be established as top priorities at the executive management level.<br>Avoid greenwashing and bluewashing.<br>Define integrity and trust as key goals for the company and its employees.<br>Especially for point 5, we must stop viewing ethics as negative moralizing and responsibility as an expensive hindrance. Instead, we should focus on the wealth of opportunities created by well-informed ethical action and establish an appropriate corporate policy. We must all take responsibility. It is the only way to protect people, animals, and the environment, as well as democracy, human rights, and human dignity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*All rights reserved to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mhp.com\/en\/company\/for-a-better-tomorrow\/five-ideas-for-integrating-corporate-digital-responsibility-into-corporate-strategy\"><u>&nbsp;MHP<\/u><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital responsibility \u2013 A Call to Action In the final article of our 5\u00d75 ideas series, we shine a light [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2331,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"","ast-site-content-layout":"default","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"set","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"ast-content-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-opacity":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"_glsr_average":0,"_glsr_ranking":0,"_glsr_reviews":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[11],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2330","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-integration-management"],"acf":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2330","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2330"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2330\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2331"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2330"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2330"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/horizonconnect.de\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2330"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
