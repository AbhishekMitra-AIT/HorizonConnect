<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/validation-and-verification-mobility/">Why Validation and Verification Are the Hidden Engines of Mobility Innovation</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we consider the future of mobility, terms such as autonomous driving, 5G connectivity, and software-defined vehicles dominate the conversation. These technologies promise efficiency, safety, and convenience. Yet, behind these high-profile innovations lies a less glamorous but essential foundation: <strong>Validation and Verification</strong>.</p>



<p>Without proper validation and verification, innovations cannot be trusted, scaled, or even legally approved for real-world use. They are the hidden engines that ensure every line of code, every communication protocol, and every safety-critical function performs exactly as intended.</p>



<p>This article explores why <strong>validation and verification</strong> are so crucial to modern mobility, how complexity is increasing, the role of regulation, and how <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Horizon Connect</a> supports automotive stakeholders in staying ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Validation and Verification: The Backbone of Automotive Innovation</strong></h2>



<p>At their core, <strong>validation and verification</strong> are about answering two critical questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> <em>Did we build the system right?</em> (Ensuring the system matches design specifications.)</li>



<li><strong>Validation:</strong> <em>Did we build the right system?</em> (Ensuring the system meets user and regulatory needs.)</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, they create a safety net that prevents faulty software, insecure networks, or poorly integrated components from reaching the road.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="459" height="443" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/v-model.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5155" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/v-model.png 459w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/v-model-300x290.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Rising Complexity of Connected Vehicles</strong></h2>



<p>The automotive industry is undergoing one of its most radical transformations in history. Vehicles are no longer just mechanical machines; they are <strong>computers on wheels</strong>, with connectivity at their core.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>100+ million lines of code</strong> are embedded in modern vehicles (compared to 10M in the early 2000s).</li>



<li><strong>Dozens of ECUs (Electronic Control Units)</strong> must interact seamlessly.</li>



<li><strong>OTA (Over-the-Air) updates</strong> continuously change vehicle software post-purchase.</li>
</ul>



<p>This exponential complexity means that <strong>validation and verification</strong> are not a one-time process. They must become <strong>continuous and adaptive</strong>, spanning the full lifecycle of a vehicle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Cost of Getting It Wrong</strong></h2>



<p>Failure to implement rigorous validation and verification can have devastating consequences:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Recalls:</strong> Software-related recalls now account for over <strong>50% of all automotive recalls</strong> in major markets.</li>



<li><strong>Safety risks:</strong> Faulty ADAS functions can create accidents rather than prevent them.</li>



<li><strong>Reputation damage:</strong> One cybersecurity flaw can erode consumer trust for years.</li>



<li><strong>Financial losses:</strong> Each large-scale recall costs automotive OEMs billions in direct and indirect costs.</li>
</ul>



<p>Case in point: In recent years, several automakers have had to recall <strong>millions of vehicles due to software bugs</strong> in braking, steering, or infotainment systems. These recalls were not caused by innovation itself, but by insufficient testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulatory Pressure Is Mounting</strong></h2>



<p>Governments and industry bodies recognize the stakes. Regulations are becoming stricter, forcing automakers and suppliers to embed <strong>validation and verification</strong> into every process.</p>



<p>Key frameworks include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>UNECE WP.29:</strong> Requires manufacturers to implement cybersecurity management and software update systems.</li>



<li><strong>ISO/SAE 21434:</strong> Focuses on cybersecurity engineering for road vehicles.</li>



<li><strong>EU Cyber Resilience Act:</strong> Expands obligations to connected systems, emphasizing continuous validation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beyond Compliance</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Validation and Verification</strong> as an Innovation Accelerator</strong></h3>



<p>Validation and verification are often perceived as slowing down innovation. In reality, they <strong>accelerate market readiness</strong> by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Detecting issues earlier in the development cycle.</li>



<li>Reducing costly redesigns and recalls.</li>



<li>Providing confidence to regulators, investors, and customers.</li>



<li>Enabling <strong>faster, safer rollouts</strong> of next-gen features like autonomous driving.</li>
</ul>



<p>For example, digital twins and simulation-driven V&amp;V allow automakers to test millions of driving scenarios virtually — cutting physical testing time by up to <strong>70%</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Horizon Connect’s Expertise in Validation and Verification</strong></h2>



<p>At Horizon Connect, we understand that <strong>innovation is only as strong as its validation process</strong>. That’s why we’ve built a unique ecosystem of tools, labs, and expertise to support automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li><strong>Cybersecurity Validation:</strong> Penetration testing, encryption validation, and compliance assessments to align with global security frameworks.</li>



<li><strong>Lifecycle Verification:</strong> Continuous monitoring and OTA validation to ensure software updates remain compliant and secure post-deployment.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future Outlook</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Validation and Verification Will Only Grow in Importance</h3>



<p>As vehicles become more autonomous and AI-driven, the importance of <strong>validation and verification</strong> will skyrocket. Consider:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Autonomous Driving (Level 4–5):</strong> Billions of real-world and simulated miles must be validated.</li>



<li><strong>AI Decision-Making:</strong> Requires explainability and verifiability to meet safety standards.</li>



<li><strong>Global Vehicle Roaming:</strong> Hybrid connectivity demands continuous cross-border testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>In this future, companies that treat V&amp;V as a strategic advantage — not a compliance burden — will lead the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The future of mobility depends not only on <em>what</em> we build but on <strong>how reliably it performs under every condition</strong>. Validation and verification may be the unsung heroes of innovation, but they are the true engines powering trust, compliance, and customer safety.</p>



<p>At Horizon Connect, we make <strong>validation and verification</strong> central to mobility innovation — ensuring that connected vehicles are not just visionary, but also safe, secure, and ready for the road.</p><p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/validation-and-verification-mobility/">Why Validation and Verification Are the Hidden Engines of Mobility Innovation</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>C-V2X Direct enables ultra-low-latency safety messaging. Horizon Connect empowers automotive OEMs with global IoT integration and seamless deployment.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/c-v2x-direct/">C-V2X Direct: Future of Vehicle Communication</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The automotive industry is moving toward a future where vehicles don’t just transport passengers but actively <strong>communicate with each other and their surroundings</strong>. At the center of this shift is <strong>C-V2X Direct</strong>, a breakthrough in direct vehicle communication that eliminates the need for cellular networks when every millisecond counts.</p>



<p>C-V2X Direct, standardized by 3GPP and championed by the 5G Automotive Association (<a href="https://5gaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">5GAA</a>), is designed to enable <strong>ultra-low-latency, real-time communication</strong> between vehicles (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and pedestrians or cyclists (V2P). With deployments already happening in Asia, North America, and Europe, this technology is set to become the foundation of global road safety.</p>



<p>At Horizon Connect, we help <strong>automotive OEMs and mobility providers</strong> adopt C-V2X Direct by integrating it seamlessly into broader IoT connectivity strategies. Our solutions ensure vehicles are globally connected, secure, and ready to meet the demands of modern mobility—anywhere, anytime.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is C-V2X Direct?</h2>



<p><strong>C-V2X</strong> stands for <em>Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything</em>, and it operates in two main modes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>C-V2X Direct (PC5 interface):</strong><br>This enables direct communication between vehicles, roadside units, and pedestrians’ devices—without going through a cellular network. It uses the <strong>5.9 GHz ITS band</strong> for ultra-reliable, short-range messages that are crucial for safety.</li>



<li><strong>C-V2X Network (Uu interface):</strong><br>This mode relies on 4G/5G cellular networks for cloud-based services such as navigation, telematics, and over-the-air (OTA) updates.</li>
</ol>



<p>The <strong>PC5 interface</strong> is what makes C-V2X Direct revolutionary. By bypassing cellular networks, it ensures that critical safety messages—like sudden braking alerts, pedestrian detection, or intersection collision warnings—are transmitted in <strong>under 20 milliseconds</strong>. This is significantly faster than human reaction time, and it works even in areas with poor network coverage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://5gaa.org/5g-technology/" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1456" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-scaled.png" alt="Diagram of V2X communication modes showing direct PC5 interface for V2V, V2I, and V2P safety messaging, and Uu network interface for V2N cloud services." class="wp-image-5109" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-scaled.png 2560w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-300x171.png 300w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-1024x582.png 1024w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-768x437.png 768w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-1536x874.png 1536w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Figure-1-–-V2X-Communication-Modes-2048x1165.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1 – V2X Communication Modes <a href="https://5gaa.org/5g-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">(Source 5GAA)</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the PC5 Interface Works</h2>



<p>The PC5 interface is a <strong>sidelink communication channel</strong>. Vehicles equipped with C-V2X Direct broadcast information up to 10 times per second, creating a <strong>real-time safety bubble</strong> around them.</p>



<p>Key technical aspects include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Autonomous Resource Allocation:</strong> Each vehicle senses available radio slots and transmits without network scheduling. This ensures reliability even in dense traffic.</li>



<li><strong>Global Spectrum Allocation:</strong> Many regions have already allocated the 5.9 GHz band for ITS safety, making C-V2X Direct viable globally.</li>



<li><strong>Always-On Capability:</strong> Messages are exchanged without requiring SIM cards, mobile coverage, or infrastructure support—ideal for emergency scenarios.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability for 5G NR-V2X:</strong> With future 5G releases, PC5 will support even more advanced use cases, including sensor sharing and cooperative driving maneuvers.</li>
</ul>



<p>In essence, C-V2X Direct equips vehicles with <strong>instant situational awareness</strong>, which can mean the difference between a safe trip and a collision.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why C-V2X Direct Matters for Road Safety</h2>



<p>The real strength of C-V2X Direct lies in its ability to enable <strong>life-saving applications</strong> that were previously impossible or unreliable with legacy technologies like DSRC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Collision Avoidance</h3>



<p>Imagine two cars approaching an intersection at high speed. One driver fails to stop at a red light. With C-V2X Direct, both cars exchange trajectory data instantly, and the system warns the drivers—or intervenes automatically—to avoid a crash.</p>



<p>5GAA demonstrations have already shown how <strong>Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL)</strong> warnings are transmitted in milliseconds, giving trailing cars the chance to react long before human reflexes would kick in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs)</h3>



<p>Cyclists and pedestrians are among the most at risk on busy roads. C-V2X Direct can connect their devices (such as smartphones or helmets) directly to nearby vehicles.</p>



<p>In one high-profile demo, Audi showcased how C-V2X Direct alerts drivers to hidden cyclists at intersections. Similarly, Autotalks tested VRU detection where a car automatically slowed after receiving an alert about a cyclist outside the driver’s field of view.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Emergency Vehicle Priority</h3>



<p>Ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles often lose precious seconds navigating through traffic. With C-V2X Direct, they can broadcast their presence directly to surrounding cars, which automatically receive warnings and clear a path—even before lights and sirens are noticed.</p>



<p>5GAA’s Atlanta “Day One Deployment District” showcased how emergency vehicles could reliably pre-empt traffic signals and warn nearby cars, reducing response times dramatically.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Road Infrastructure Integration</h3>



<p>Traffic signals and roadside sensors can also communicate via C-V2X Direct. Use cases include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Red Light Violation Warning (RLVW):</strong> Alerts drivers if they’re about to run a red light.</li>



<li><strong>Road Works Warning (RWW):</strong> Notifies vehicles of upcoming construction zones.</li>



<li><strong>Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA):</strong> Helps drivers adjust speed to catch a green wave.</li>
</ul>



<p>These applications not only improve safety but also reduce congestion and emissions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Global Deployment Roadmap of C-V2X Direct</h2>



<p>C-V2X Direct is no longer a future vision—it is actively being deployed worldwide.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>China:</strong> Since 2020, multiple OEMs have launched C-V2X-equipped models. Over 90 cities and 5,000 km of smart roads support C-V2X with roadside units.</li>



<li><strong>Europe:</strong> EU projects like C-Roads and 5G corridors are preparing infrastructure. Mass deployment of <strong>C-V2X Direct is projected between 2026–2029</strong>, starting with major transport corridors.</li>



<li><strong>North America:</strong> In 2020, the FCC reserved 30 MHz of spectrum for C-V2X. By 2025, live deployment districts like Atlanta have already demonstrated real-world use cases.</li>
</ul>



<p>By <strong>2030</strong>, industry roadmaps predict hundreds of millions of vehicles globally will be equipped with C-V2X Direct, enabling a truly cooperative transport ecosystem.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Discover how 5G-TSN integration ensures low-latency, reliable communication for connected and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/5g-tsn-automotive-connectivity/">5G-TSN Integration: The Future of Automotive Connectivity</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The automotive industry is at the precipice of a transformative shift, driven by the powerful synergy of&nbsp;<strong>5G technology</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</strong>. This groundbreaking fusion, known as&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>, promises to redefine how vehicles communicate, ensuring unparalleled levels of safety, efficiency, and intelligence. By merging the high-speed, flexible capabilities of 5G with the ultra-reliable, low-latency guarantees of TSN, we are moving towards a future where vehicles are not just connected, but seamlessly integrated into a larger, dynamic ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-1">Key Insights into 5G-TSN Integration</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deterministic Communication:</strong>&nbsp;5G-TSN integration provides the critical ability to guarantee timely data delivery, essential for safety-critical automotive functions like autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</li>



<li><strong>Seamless V2X Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;This integration extends real-time, reliable communication beyond the vehicle, enabling robust Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions, which are crucial for coordinated maneuvers and traffic management.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced In-Vehicle Networking:</strong>&nbsp;By consolidating diverse communication buses onto a unified Ethernet-based network, 5G-TSN integration simplifies vehicle architecture, reduces complexity, and supports the evolving demands of software-defined vehicles.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-2">The Core of 5G-TSN Integration: A Technological Deep Dive</h2>



<p>At its heart,&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;is about combining the best of both worlds: the wireless prowess of 5G and the wired precision of TSN. 5G, the fifth generation of wireless communication, brings immense bandwidth, ultra-low latency (often less than 1 millisecond in ideal conditions), and the capacity to connect a massive number of devices simultaneously. These attributes are vital for external vehicle communication, cloud services, and real-time data exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, TSN is a suite of IEEE Ethernet standards designed to provide deterministic communication. This means guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency (often below 100 microseconds with jitter less than 1 microsecond), and highly reliable data transfer, even under heavy network load. TSN is particularly critical for time-sensitive applications within the vehicle, where every microsecond counts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Industrial Use Cases</strong> (For Automotive OEMs)</h2>



<p>A modern, future-ready industrial network typically operates across three main connectivity layers, as illustrated in Figure 1.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1495" height="842" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5068" style="width:1241px;height:auto" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png 1495w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-300x169.png 300w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-1024x577.png 1024w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1495px) 100vw, 1495px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">TSN in a Factory
Figure 1: Example of TSN deployment in a factory setting</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the <strong>central management layer</strong>, the vehicle manufacturer’s backend systems—or an automotive edge cloud—host key control, management, and data processing functions. This layer communicates with fleets, connected infrastructure, and service platforms.</p>



<p>At the <strong>vehicle domain level</strong>, different domains such as the powertrain, chassis, infotainment, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are interconnected. Each domain contains electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, and actuators. The <strong>TSN backbone</strong> inside the vehicle provides deterministic transport services both between domains and from domains to the central management layer.</p>



<p>Within a domain, <strong>Controller-to-Device (C2D)</strong> communication ensures that safety-critical commands—such as braking, steering adjustments, or adaptive suspension settings—are executed in real time. This is comparable to <em>Stream C</em> in industrial setups. When domains need to coordinate—such as chassis and powertrain for stability control—<strong>Controller-to-Controller (C2C)</strong> communication (<em>Stream B</em>) is used, requiring equally stringent timing guarantees.</p>



<p>Some data flows are less time-sensitive but still essential, such as telemetry uploads, diagnostics, and over-the-air updates. This <strong>Device-to-Compute (D2Cmp)</strong> communication (<em>Stream A</em>) typically moves from in-vehicle sensors to cloud servers or OEM analytics platforms.</p>



<p>In a <strong>software-defined vehicle</strong> architecture, control functions are no longer bound to specific hardware ECUs. Instead, they can be virtualized in an automotive edge cloud. For example, <em>Stream D</em> could represent a vehicle function—like energy management—being controlled from the cloud. Likewise, <em>Stream E</em> could represent real-time coordination between multiple virtualized control functions across a connected vehicle fleet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-3">Why 5G-TSN Integration is a Game-Changer for Automotive</h2>



<p>The modern vehicle is an increasingly complex, software-defined machine. Features like ADAS and autonomous driving demand communication networks that are not only fast but also incredibly precise and predictable. This is where&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;proves indispensable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Achieving Deterministic Communication</h3>



<p>TSN ensures that critical data, such as emergency braking commands or sensor fusion outputs, is delivered within a guaranteed timeframe, even during periods of heavy data traffic. This deterministic behavior is vital for safety-critical systems where delays could have catastrophic consequences. By extending these guarantees via 5G, the vehicle can maintain real-time capabilities even when communicating with external entities, such as infrastructure or other vehicles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enabling Seamless Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication</h3>



<p><strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;is foundational for robust V2X communication, encompassing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) interactions. This enables real-time hazard warnings, optimized traffic flow, and cooperative maneuvers between autonomous vehicles, significantly improving road safety and efficiency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-4">Key Technologies Driving 5G-TSN Integration</h2>



<p>Several key technologies underpin the successful integration of 5G and TSN in automotive environments:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>3GPP Standards:</strong>&nbsp;Specifically, Release 16 and beyond incorporate features that enable 5G systems to act as logical TSN bridges. This allows for seamless interoperability between wired TSN networks within vehicles and the wireless 5G network, ensuring data integrity and timing synchronization across domains.</li>



<li><strong>Precision Time Protocol (PTP):</strong>&nbsp;PTP (IEEE 802.1AS) is crucial for synchronizing devices within the vehicle network with microsecond accuracy. This level of synchronization is essential for coordinated sensor data processing, control decisions, and ensuring that all components operate on a common time reference.</li>



<li><strong>Switched Ethernet Architectures:</strong>&nbsp;Moving away from shared bus systems to switched Ethernet within the vehicle ensures deterministic, lossless packet delivery, which is a prerequisite for advanced autonomous driving functions.</li>



<li><strong>TSN Bridging (DS-TT and NW-TT):</strong>&nbsp;These components facilitate the seamless handoff of time-sensitive data between the TSN domain and the 5G core network, preserving timing guarantees across wired and wireless segments.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="heading-7">Challenges and the Path Forward</h2>



<p>While the advantages of&nbsp;<strong>5G-TSN integration</strong>&nbsp;are compelling, several challenges remain. Ensuring widespread 5G network coverage, particularly in diverse geographical areas, is a significant undertaking.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="429" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Connected-Autonomous-Vehicles-CAV-functions-requirements-and-architecture-within-6G.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5038" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Connected-Autonomous-Vehicles-CAV-functions-requirements-and-architecture-within-6G.png 850w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Connected-Autonomous-Vehicles-CAV-functions-requirements-and-architecture-within-6G-300x151.png 300w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Connected-Autonomous-Vehicles-CAV-functions-requirements-and-architecture-within-6G-768x388.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How 6G V2X NOMA Enhances V2X Communication</strong></h2>



<p>V2X (<strong>Vehicle-to-Everything</strong>) enables communication between vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, and networks. Traditional <strong>Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA)</strong> assigns distinct time/frequency slots to each user, but this can become inefficient in high-density scenarios.</p>



<p><strong>Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)</strong> changes the game by allowing multiple users to <strong>share the same channel resources</strong> via <strong>superposition coding</strong> in the power domain and separating them at the receiver with <strong>Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)</strong>.</p>



<p>In <strong>dense 6G V2X environments</strong>—urban intersections, vehicle platoons, or smart corridors—this approach can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Boost spectral efficiency</strong> by enabling overlapping transmissions.</li>



<li><strong>Reduce latency</strong> by avoiding scheduling delays.</li>



<li><strong>Increase capacity</strong> under heavy load, especially in sidelink (V2V) communications.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Typical NOMA Schemes:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Power-domain NOMA</strong> – High-power broadcasts (e.g., hazard alerts) share the channel with lower-power unicast streams.</li>



<li><strong>Code-domain NOMA</strong> – Methods like Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) allow multiple transmissions using distinct codebooks.</li>
</ul>



<p>While <strong>security</strong>, <strong>fairness</strong>, and <strong>standardization</strong> remain challenges—especially since 3GPP has yet to adopt NOMA for V2X—research is exploring <strong>hybrid OMA/NOMA approaches</strong> and integration with new waveforms like <strong>OTFS</strong> for high-speed vehicles.</p>



<p><strong>In short,</strong> NOMA offers the <strong>massive connectivity</strong> and <strong>low-latency performance</strong> required for autonomous driving and tactile feedback in next-generation mobility systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Spectrum Efficiency: OMA vs NOMA</h3>



<p>Using NOMA in V2X improves spectrum utilization dramatically compared to traditional OMA by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Allowing multiple users to share the entire channel simultaneously.</li>



<li>Employing power-domain multiplexing and SIC (Successive Interference Cancellation) for efficient decoding.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="732" height="421" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Comparison-of-multiple-users-sharing-the-frequency-spectrum-between-OMA-and-NOMA.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5039" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Comparison-of-multiple-users-sharing-the-frequency-spectrum-between-OMA-and-NOMA.png 732w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Comparison-of-multiple-users-sharing-the-frequency-spectrum-between-OMA-and-NOMA-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></figure>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dynamic traffic flow optimisation</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Coordinated vehicle platooning</strong> for fuel efficiency and safety.</li>



<li><strong>Instant hazard alerts</strong> for improved accident prevention.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Challenges to Address</strong></h2>



<p>Despite its promise, <strong>6G V2X NOMA</strong> faces several challenges:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Explore how a Security Operations Center (SOC) safeguards connected cars. Learn SOC benefits and best practices in automotive cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://horizonconnect.de/soc-in-automotive-cybersecurity-secure-connected-vehicles/">SOC in Automotive Cybersecurity – Secure Connected Vehicles</a> first appeared on <a href="https://horizonconnect.de">Automotive Connectivity Provider | Horizon Connect</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern vehicles are essentially computers on wheels, with dozens of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and millions of lines of software code. This connectivity, from GPS and infotainment to V2X and over-the-air updates, makes <strong>automotive cybersecurity</strong> critical. Hackers can target vehicle networks to steal personal data or even hijack vehicle controls. A dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) for automotive systems continuously monitors vehicle traffic, telematics servers, and cloud services 24/7 to detect and respond to these threats in real time. In this article, we explain what an automotive SOC does, why it’s essential for modern vehicles, and the key benefits it provides.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a SOC in Automotive Cybersecurity?</h2>



<p>A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team and platform for monitoring and managing security threats. In the automotive world, a <strong>Vehicle SOC (VSOC)</strong> extends this concept to cars and connected mobility. According to security experts, “a SOC is a team that deals with security issues” at a technical level, using dedicated tools to constantly monitor an organization’s IT and network infrastructure. A Vehicle SOC does the same but also watches over the car-specific components – everything from the <strong>connected vehicle cloud</strong> and fleet management systems to the vehicles themselves, including on-board sensors and radars. In effect, an automotive SOC acts as the cybersecurity command center for a manufacturer or fleet, aggregating data from vehicle ECUs, telematics units, and cloud services to detect anomalies and incidents.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-683x1024.webp" alt="Key components of an automotive Security Operations Center." class="wp-image-4818" srcset="https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-683x1024.webp 683w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-200x300.webp 200w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center-768x1152.webp 768w, https://horizonconnect.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Key-components-of-an-automotive-Security-Operations-Center.webp 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Key components of an automotive Security Operations Center.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The diagram above illustrates a typical SOC architecture. A SOC ingests data logs (from ECUs, on-board networks, and cloud connectors), aggregates and correlates events, and applies threat intelligence. Security analysts or automated tools then triage alerts and trigger incident response actions. As <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/security-operations-centre#:~:text=What%27s%20a%20SOC%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Thales</a> puts it, a SOC is “the command center for identifying emerging cybersecurity threats and responding immediately to mitigate risk”. By centralizing visibility across the entire connected vehicle ecosystem, a SOC can quickly spot malicious behavior, for example, abnormal network packets or unauthorized firmware changes, and contain them before they affect the vehicle or backend systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cybersecurity Threats to Connected Vehicles</h2>



<p>Today’s vehicles are “rolling data centers,” connected to multiple networks. This connectivity brings convenience but also exposes vehicles to cyberattacks. Common threats in the automotive landscape include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vehicle Hacking:</strong> Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ECUs or V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) links to manipulate car functions (e.g., engine, brakes, or locks).</li>



<li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Personal information and telemetry data stored in cloud services or in-vehicle systems can be stolen or leaked.</li>



<li><strong>Ransomware Attacks:</strong> Cybercriminals may encrypt or lock down a vehicle’s systems (infotainment, telematics, etc.) and demand payment to restore access.</li>



<li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Malicious code can be introduced during software updates or through compromised components in the vehicle supply chain.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/secure-futures-magazine/vehicle-security-operations-center/36596/#:~:text=Operating%20systems%20in%20connected%20vehicles,the%20consequences%20could%20be%20devastating" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Kaspersky Security</a> warns that if a hacker “remotely hijacks the operating system of one of your vehicles,” the consequences could be devastating. Given these risks, automotive manufacturers and fleet operators need robust monitoring and quick response capabilities. A SOC provides this 24/7 vigilance, acting like a security watchdog for every network and device in the connected car domain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Benefits of SOC in Automotive Cybersecurity</h2>



<p>Implementing an automotive SOC brings several important advantages:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Continuous Threat Detection:</strong> A SOC continuously scans vehicle networks and cloud infrastructure for anomalies. Horizon Connect notes that an SOC service offers “round-the-clock monitoring to detect and respond to threats in real time”. This means suspicious signals in the data flow – like unusual commands sent to an ECU or abnormal login attempts – are caught immediately.</li>



<li><strong>Rapid Incident Response:</strong> When a threat is detected, the SOC team can act instantly to isolate and contain it. This might involve cutting off a hacked vehicle from the fleet network or rolling out an emergency update. Quick response “prevents downtime” and minimizes impact on drivers and manufacturers. Thales emphasizes that uninterrupted monitoring by an SOC “improves response times when security issues occur,” reducing damage and costs.</li>



<li><strong>Centralized Visibility:</strong> A dedicated automotive SOC provides a single pane of glass for the entire vehicle ecosystem. It correlates data from ECUs, mobile apps, infrastructure sensors, and more. By centralizing this visibility, it becomes much easier to spot patterns of attack that span multiple vehicles or systems. For example, an SOC can detect if a batch of cars suddenly tries to contact a suspicious IP address.</li>



<li><strong>Threat Intelligence &amp; Analytics:</strong> Modern SOCs leverage AI and machine learning to predict and prevent attacks. As Horizon Connect highlights, SOC platforms use “AI-driven analytics to predict and neutralize attacks before they occur”. This proactive intelligence is crucial for automotive cybersecurity, where new malware or attack methods can emerge rapidly.</li>



<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Many countries now mandate automotive cybersecurity standards (e.g., UNECE WP.29, ISO/SAE 21434). A SOC helps meet these requirements by continuously monitoring and documenting cyber risks. Detailed reporting from a SOC makes it easier to show regulators that security measures are in place and up-to-date.</li>
</ul>



<p>These benefits make a SOC a foundational element of a mature automotive cybersecurity strategy. Figure [11] (above) highlights components like log collection, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and threat intelligence feeds that together enable these capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing an Automotive SOC</h2>



<p>Building an effective Vehicle SOC can be done in-house or by outsourcing to experts. Some large OEMs and fleet operators establish their own VSOCs, while others partner with specialized cybersecurity firms (offering “SOC as a Service”). Regardless of the approach, key steps include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integrate Vehicle Data Streams:</strong> Ensure that all vehicle and network logs (from telematics, diagnostic sensors, mobile apps, etc.) feed into the SOC’s monitoring platform. This may involve deploying onboard intrusion detection systems or cloud agents to collect telemetry.</li>



<li><strong>Develop Incident Playbooks:</strong> Prepare response procedures for different scenarios (e.g., remote takeover attempts, data breach, malware outbreak). Analysts should know how to escalate issues and whom to notify in each case. As one expert notes, escalating vehicle monitoring alerts straight to the SOC is critical for quick remediation.</li>



<li><strong>Leverage Threat Intelligence:</strong> Subscribe to multiple threat feeds (from industry groups, security vendors, etc.) and continuously update the SOC’s knowledge base. Correlating external intelligence with vehicle behavior helps spot known attack patterns.</li>



<li><strong>Regular Training and Testing:</strong> SOC analysts need specialized training on automotive systems, which differ from IT networks. Regular drills and penetration tests (e.g., red-team exercises on vehicles) help ensure the SOC is ready. Horizon Connect also recommends fuzz testing and white-hat hacking programs to find vulnerabilities before adversaries do.</li>
</ol>



<p>In some cases, vehicles can even report their own issues to the SOC. For example, onboard modules might automatically flag unusual commands or sensor readings back to the SOC dashboard. This feeds the SOC with richer data to analyze. Ultimately, whether run internally or by a vendor, the goal of the SOC is the same: “minimize the chances of a cybersecurity breach” across your entire fleet, so engineers can focus on building the future of transport.</p>

<p>The graphic above illustrates a typical connected vehicle ecosystem. Each interface (cellular, V2X, OTA updates, Bluetooth) can be an entry point for attackers. A SOC in <strong>automotive cybersecurity</strong> monitors all these links and internal vehicle networks. For instance, if a car’s infotainment unit suddenly transmits data to an unknown server, the SOC would generate an alert for analysts to investigate. By correlating data from hundreds or thousands of vehicles, the SOC can identify even subtle threats (such as malware that only activates under certain conditions).</p>
